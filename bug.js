```javascript
//In your main app.js file
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code will not work as expected because the path to the tailwind.css file might be incorrect. Tailwind directives may not work in certain versions of React. You will encounter issues compiling CSS or seeing any styles applied in the browser.
